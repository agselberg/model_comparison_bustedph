Used data from paper:

Halabi K, Karin EL, Gu√©guen L, Mayrose I. 2021. A Codon Model for Associating Phenotypic Traits with Altered Selective Patterns of Sequence Evolution. Syst. Biol. 70:60-622.

They looked at two different datasets:
First: SEMG2 gene comparing polygynandrous primates (FG) to non-polygynandrous primates (BG)
Second: 68 proteobacteria genes comparing 16 endosymbiontsFG) and 34 free-living species (BG)
