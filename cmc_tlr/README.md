### COMPARING BUSTED-PH TO CLADE MODEL C (PAML)

Used data from paper:

Yohe LR, Davies KTJ, Rossiter SJ, DÃ¡valos LM. 2019. Expressed Vomeronasal Type-1 Receptors (V1rs) in Bats Uncover Conserved Sequences Underlying Social Chemical Signaling.Chang B, editor. Genome Biol. Evol. 11:2741i-2749.


3 genes (p1, p2, p3 .phy) were tested with two clade hypotheses (cmc_orgroupA.nwk and cmc_orgroupC.nwk)

Note: their paper originally discussed 3 hypotheses but the authors discarded outgroup B due to lack of power.
